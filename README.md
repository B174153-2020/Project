# Project: Machine Learning in Directed Evolution for Improving the Thermal Stability of Cellulase

The embeddings_reproduction tool is from: https://github.com/fhalab/embeddings_reproduction/.

The word2vec files used in the embeddings_reproduction tool are not included since they are too large. But they are all available from:  http://cheme.caltech.edu/~kkyang/.
